### gg210824_gou_cir.ipynb
Code to reproduce the figures and results in the paper. 

### data
Includes simulation parameters and all simulation data.

### functions
``CIR_functions.py`` includes functions that compute steady state distribution of 2 species CIR based on analytical results.

``GOU_functions.py`` includes functions that compute steady state distribution of 2 species Î“-OU and divergence between two models.

``autocorr_functions.py`` computes the autocorrelation function.

``CIR_Gillespie_functions.py`` implements the Gillespie algorithm for 2 species CIR.
